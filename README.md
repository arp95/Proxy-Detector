# Proxy-Detector Android App
Proxy Detector is an Attendence Management System Android App aimes to detect the number of students identified by their branch , roll number , year in a classroom .
Each user/student has to register themselves as student providing their details like Name , Roll_No , Branch , Year etc .
Each professor registers themselves as teachers which give them the authority to check the number of students in a particular block of area.
The information is stored in a local SQLite db for now .The location of each student is tracked by getting their latitude and longitude coordinates using the Google Play Services Location Api .
### Challenges faced in this app :
The major drawback of this app is that not all students will have an android phone thus it cannot be used as a universal system for attending roll calls . 
Also the student whose phone battery is down will not be able to attend the roll call .
