# Proxy-Detector Android App
Proxy Detector is an Attendence Management System Android App which aims to detect the number of students identified by their branch , roll number , year in a classroom .

Each user/student has to register themselves as student providing their details like Name , Roll_No , Branch , Year etc .
Each professor registers themselves as teachers which give them the authority to check the number of students in a particular block of area.

The information is stored in a local SQLite db for now .The location of each student is tracked by getting their latitude and longitude coordinates using the Google Play Services Location Api .

If anyone is interested in this project feel free to contact me .
